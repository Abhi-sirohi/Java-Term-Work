1.	WAP in java to simulate condition to generate Wi-Fi password. Take input as Name, City, Age and Gender.
Constraints:
a.	Length of name and city should be greater or equal to 3.
b.	Age can`t be 18.
Output Constraints:
a.	If Gender=F and Age<18
Password: 1st 3 char of name + sum of digit of age + last 3 char of city
b.	Else If gender=F and Age>18
Password: last 3 char of Name + Diff of digit of age(Positive) + 1st 3 char of City.
c.	Else
Password: 1st char of name + 1st char of city + 2nd char of name + 2nd char of city …
Append this to length of max string(name or city) and then concatenate with Age to get password.
2.	WAP in Java to initialize a string in order to find that character which frequency is 2nd most in that string.
3.	WAP to check longest sub sequence of a same character in an initialized string?[aaaabppppp, p=5] [aabbcc, a=2].
4.	WAP to generate wifi key as user will enter form value Name,City,Age and Gender?
=>If gender is Male then key will be First 3 Character of Name+Difference of age digit+Last 3 Character of city
=> If gender is Female then key will be last 3 character of Name+sum of age digit+first 3 character of city

9.	WAP in an Applet Make two Button  one is Circle within Square  and second is Square within Circle. When user click on Circle within Square then draw Circle within Square. And when user click on Square within Circle then draw Square within Circle on the panel window?
10.	 WAP to put one Exception class in a package and to use this Exception class object in an another package class method any how?
11.	WAP to initialize 2D string array at runtime and to print reverse value of diagonal position only?
12.	WAP to show the Working of multithreading . Make separate program by using Runnable  interface And by using Thread Class .also use their methods . 
13.	WAP using Applet to draw circle, line ,rectangle and fill them with a color given by the user.
14.	WAP to implement a color menu which have four options red, Green, Blue and Exit. When we’ll Press red, green, blue color it will set that color as background color and on exit we need to exit from the window.
15.	WAP to show the use of KeyListener/MouseListener  interface in order to generate and process those events.

21.	WAP to show the use of synchronized keyword in producer consumer problem.
22.	WAP for following OUTPUT 
String s="san12may4tya7yyy678rtb62tp"
Output 2 will 4*7=28
Output 1 will sanmytrbp
Output 3 will 12+678+62=690+62 =....
23.  Enter a no and than create array of its digits.
I.e
If no is 123456 than 
Store it's digit in int array of size 6 as 
If array is a than a[0] should 1 and a[1] should 2......
Also after storing in array a then reverse it's all value without using another array i.e 
After reversing a[0] should 6 and a[1] should 5 ......
print common elemnts of both array.
24.	Wap to initlize two integer array of user enterd size .Then perform following operations
1.add elements in that array which  is longest .
I.e. if first array is of 3 size having elements 1,2,3
Second array is of size five and elements are 4,5,6,7,8
Than result array will second and now it's elements will 5,7,9,7,8
25.	 Initlize integer array of any size containg values 0 and 1 only.
Now check which is longest series of either 0 or 1 ,which is existing.
I.e. if array values are
{1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1}
Ans is 0 and length is 5
If there is same series of 0 and 1 then ans will which is existing first
I.e. if array values are
{1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1}
Ans is 1 and length is 3
As 1,1,1 comming first before 0,0 0
